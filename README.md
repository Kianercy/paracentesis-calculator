# paracentesis-calculator
Recurrent tense ascites is a frequent consequence of decompensated cirrhosis and often necessitates repeated large-volume paracentesis (LVP). A Bayesian framework allows clinicians to combine baseline risks with patient-specific factors such as MELD or MELD-Na, serum sodium, refractory ascites status, and albumin use during LVP to estimate the probability of repeat paracentesis and guide management decisions. 
This app caculate prior and post-test probabilities for recurrent
paracentesis, then use Bayesian calculations , as a practical bedside algorithm for hospitalized or clinic patients
with ascites, linking risk stratification to decisions about diuretics, albumin, scheduled outpatient LVP, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and transplant
evaluation.
