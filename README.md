Recurrent tense ascites is a frequent consequence of decompensated cirrhosis and
often necessitates repeated large-volume paracentesis (LVP). A Bayesian framework
allows clinicians to combine baseline risks with patient-specific factors such as MELD
or MELD-Na, serum sodium, refractory ascites status, and albumin use during LVP to
estimate the probability of repeat paracentesis and guide management decisions. This
article first reviews key data that inform prior and post-test probabilities for recurrent
paracentesis, then illustrates stepwise Bayesian calculations with worked examples.
Finally, a practical bedside algorithm is proposed for hospitalized or clinic patients
with ascites, linking risk stratification to decisions about diuretics, albumin, scheduled
outpatient LVP, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and transplant
evaluation.
